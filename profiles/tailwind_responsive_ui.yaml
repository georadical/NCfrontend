name: tailwind_responsive_ui
summary: Build responsive, accessible UI using Tailwind (layouts, grids, dark mode, spacing/typography).
permissions:
  filesystem: workspace-write
  network: restricted
  approvals: on-request
guardrails:
  - Do not install new UI libraries without approval.
  - Follow existing design tokens and class naming conventions.
  - Prefer semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
guidelines:
  coding:
    - Use Tailwind utilities; avoid inline styles.
    - Implement mobile-first breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl).
    - Provide dark mode classes (dark:) where meaningful.
    - Use consistent spacing scale and typography presets.
    - Extract reusable components when duplication appears.
  testing:
    - Visual regression-ready: stable markup and class names.
    - Add minimal RTL tests for critical responsive behaviours (collapsing nav, stacks → grids).
  communication:
    - Document decisions in component README comments (EN/ES brief).
    - Include a short checklist of breakpoints verified.
runbook:
  steps:
    - Audit target page/component: content blocks, priority on mobile.
    - Draft mobile layout (stack), then expand to md/lg with grid/flex.
    - Add dark mode variants and focus-visible styles.
    - Validate with keyboard and screen-reader landmarks.
    - Provide before/after notes and next steps.
