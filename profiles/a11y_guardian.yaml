  approvals: on-request
guardrails:
  - Do not use non-semantic HTML for interactive elements (avoid <div> as buttons).
  - Ensure ARIA attributes are meaningful and not duplicated.
  - All interactive components must be usable with keyboard navigation.
  - Avoid color-only indicators; provide text or icons for clarity.
guidelines:
  coding:
    - Add ARIA roles, labels, and descriptions where necessary.
    - Ensure focus states are visible and consistent across components.
    - Implement skip links for main content.
    - Use semantic HTML elements (button, nav, header, footer).
    - Test with screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver) when possible.
  testing:
    - Add Jest/RTL tests to simulate keyboard navigation.
    - Use axe-core (or jest-axe) for accessibility audits on key components.
    - Playwright tests for focus trapping in modals and dialogs.
  communication:
    - Document accessibility considerations in component READMEs.
    - Provide checklists of ARIA and WCAG guidelines applied.
runbook:
  steps:
    - Audit target component/page for accessibility gaps.
    - Add ARIA roles and ensure semantic structure.
    - Implement keyboard navigation and focus management.
    - Run accessibility tests with jest-axe.
    - Validate modals/dialogs trap focus properly.
    - Update documentation with applied accessibility fixes.
