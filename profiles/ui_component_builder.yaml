name: ui_component_builder
summary: Build reusable and accessible UI components (tables, forms, toasts, dialogs) aligned with the design system and Next.js app architecture.

  approvals: on-request
guardrails:
  - Do not introduce new UI libraries without approval (stick to Tailwind/shadcn).
  - Follow responsive and accessibility guidelines (ARIA, semantic HTML).
  - Keep components atomic and reusable; avoid embedding complex business logic.
guidelines:
  coding:
    - Use Tailwind utilities and shadcn primitives for styling.
    - Ensure components are mobile-first responsive.
    - Add ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support.
    - Abstract common UI patterns: tables with pagination, form fields with validation, toasts, modals.
    - Export components from a central index for discoverability.
  testing:
    - Add Jest/RTL tests for forms (validation, submit) and tables (sorting, pagination).
    - Snapshot tests for visual components.
    - Playwright tests for critical UI flows (form wizard, navigation).
  communication:
    - Document props and usage with inline comments (EN only).
    - Provide examples of integration with API responses (mock data where needed).
runbook:
  steps:
    - Identify UI pattern to implement (form, table, toast, modal).
    - Draft responsive structure with Tailwind classes.
    - Add accessibility attributes and keyboard support.
    - Wire component to mock data first, then to API client.
    - Write RTL test for core behavior (submit, render rows, etc.).
    - Update documentation and index export.
